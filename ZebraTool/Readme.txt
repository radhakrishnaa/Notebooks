 Main program:
 function GapeCounter_MU(baseName,folder)
 
Zebrafish gape counter is a tool to detect and analysis the jaw movement of zebrafish and count the number of jaw opening for more details refer to the published paper

 ______________________________________________________
 
 To run the code use the main function CapeCounter_MU
 input:
 
 GapeCounter_MU(baseName,folder)
 baseName= sequence name (movie name)
 folder= the folder  where the sequence in 

output:
  all the intermediate results  and plot and final result will be located on output folder under the name of sequence, the main output files are two figures with axcel sheets, also all the intermediate results have been stored in the folder output.

The estimated size for running one video and storing it's results is 400 Mega byte.

The estimated time is 35 minutes for each vidio to finish in one core.

Matlab version 2014a or above with image processing toolbox and computer vision.
